- ðŸ‘‹ Hi,
- 2023 Iâ€™m currently exploring EVM and solidity and python fintech, api, bots.
Architect-turned-engineer with 3Â½ years designing and deploying on-chain systems where AI agents, algorithmic trading loops, and Solidity smart contracts converge. Combines structural-design discipline with deep Python + EVM knowledge to deliver reliable autonomous systems and token ecosystems. A ruthless problem solver who acts swiftly and decisively to create effective solutions. My intrinsic value lies in multidisciplinary design practices, where fundamentals converge, turning possibilities into probabilities.
